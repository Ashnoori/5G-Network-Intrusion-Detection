# 5G-IoT-Network-Intrusion-Detection

The 5G network provides higher bandwidth and lower latency for edge IoT devices to access the core business network. However, it also increases the attack surface of the core network, making the enterprise network more vulnerable to security attacks. The network architecture must be able to recognise not just abnormal traffic, but also new emerging threats in order to preserve the security of essential business. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are commonly employed to safeguard the core network against external intrusions and threats. To this end, in this project, I produced a comparison study of different machine learning models that could be used in network intrusion detection, and the modelsâ€™ performance in terms of accuracy, precision, execution time, etc. The models are also evaluated on the publicly available BotNet-IoT dataset. Such a study will provide significant insights into how a variety of ML algorithms perform over a benchmark dataset, assisting researchers and industry in the design and development of real-time autonomous IoT NIDS.
